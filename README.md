This is a prototype project based on two parts that K and W worked on previously, including a LED strip that updates brightness and color periodically, and a heartbeat sensor that reads in real-time heartbeat data. 

We aim to combine the two parts so that the LED strip will reflect the heartbeat in a real-time fashion, which can be further integrated into accessories or clothese as wearable art.

The hardware includes:
1. A microcontroller: raspberry pico that runs micropython
2. Pulse sensor for heartbeat data
3. LED strip WS2812

The connection diagram of the circuit is to be written/drawn....

The software includes:
1. main.py that reads heartbeat data and show it in the brightness of the LED
